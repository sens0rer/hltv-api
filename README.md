# hltv-scraper
A thing I'm writing because existing third-party hltv.org APIs did not give me the data I needed.
The data this scraper provides is still non-exhaustive and will never be. The reason for that is that I only cared to go as deep as I need to for my small ML project.

The old implementation is based on string manipulation which is dumb. Working on rewriting it using BS4
