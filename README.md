# hltv-parser
A thing I'm writing because existing hltv.org APIs did not give me the data I needed

This is written horribly and will break with any changes to how HLTV data is structured. Also, the code is pretty much unreadable and impossible to maintain since it consists mostly of string manipulation. I will write some documentation regarding usage at some point though
